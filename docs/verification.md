# What has been checked

For anybody deciding how much to trust this. What was verified directly, what
was not, and the limits worth knowing before you rely on a diagram.

## What has been checked, and what has not

Some of this is observed behaviour and some of it is reasonable inference. The
difference matters if you hit a problem, so:

**Checked directly**, against UniFi Network 10.5.67 on a UDM Pro Max:
authentication, every endpoint used, artwork lookup for both UniFi hardware and
clients, the icon font fallback, both layouts, both themes, all five output
formats, the offline and no-artwork paths, and opening the generated `.drawio`
in draw.io.

**Not checked:**

- **More than one site.** The test console has a single site. The advice above
  about internal site names comes from how UniFi behaves generally, not from
  something observed here, which is why it points you at the URL and the API
  rather than telling you what the value will look like.
- **Importing into Lucid.** Lucid documents `.drawio` import; that has not been
  tried with a file from this tool.
- **Any controller other than a UDM Pro Max**, or any Network version other than
  10.5.67. Older or newer controllers may move or reshape these endpoints.

If any of these turn out to be broken, that is a bug worth reporting rather than
a known limitation.

## Caveats

- Only **active** clients appear. A powered-off device isn't in `stat/sta` and
  won't be on the map.
- Wireless client counts drift between runs as devices roam and sleep. Two
  snapshots minutes apart won't match exactly; that's the network, not a bug.
- `cache/` holds a MAC, hostname and IP inventory of every device on your
  network. It's gitignored and written `0600`. Don't commit it or paste it into
  an issue.
