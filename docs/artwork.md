# Artwork

Where the pictures come from, what happens when there are none, and the
licensing position.

## Where the artwork comes from

Three separate sources, none of them vendored here:

| What | Source | Key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UniFi hardware | `static.ui.com/fingerprint/ui/public.json` + `.../ui/images/...` | hardware `sysid` |
| Clients | `static.ui.com/fingerprint/0/{dev_id}_257x257.png` | fingerprint `dev_id` from `stat/sta` |
| UniFi gear seen as a client | the same catalogue as UniFi hardware | hostname, plus a device type from another app |
| Generic client glyphs | the controller's own icon font (`fonts/ubnt-icon`) | user/guest x wired/wireless |

The client artwork endpoint is `staticFingerprintOld` in the Network UI's own
config. The controller also serves the fingerprint database itself at
`/proxy/network/v2/api/fingerprint_devices/0` (5789 devices), which is what turns
an unnamed client into "Govee H61E1 / Smart Light Strip".

Note that the controller does **not** host device images: every path under its
web app's static assets returns the SPA's HTML 404. Only the icon font is local.

## UniFi hardware that appears as a client

A UniFi device on a switch port that the Network app has not adopted (a Protect
camera, for example) is just a client: no fingerprint, so nothing to look up. Its
hostname is the only handle, and hostnames are ambiguous. `g3-flex` matches both
`UVC-G3-FLEX`, a Protect camera, and `UA-G3-Flex`, an Access door reader.

So the hostname is matched against the hardware catalogue, and a match is only
used when it is unique. To break ties, other UniFi apps are asked what they know:
if Protect reports that MAC as a camera, only camera entries are considered, and
`g3-flex` then resolves to exactly one. If a name stays ambiguous, the generic
glyph is used rather than a coin flip.

This needs no extra configuration. `/proxy/protect/integration/v1/cameras` is
fetched when present and ignored when Protect is not installed.

## Matching

Devices are matched to Ubiquiti's device catalog on **sysid**, not model name:
the controller's `model` string doesn't reliably match the catalog's shortnames
(a USW Pro HD 24 PoE reports `USWED72` while the catalog calls it `USPH24P`).

The graph is built from `stat/device` uplinks plus `stat/sta` and `networkconf`,
then completed with the controller's own `v2/.../topology` graph for clients the
first two cannot place. That endpoint is read defensively, since it is a v2 API
whose structure has changed before: anything unexpected in it yields nothing
rather than raising, so a controller upgrade degrades the map instead of breaking
the run.

## Fixing a wrong icon in the console instead

Before reaching for an overrides file, try the console. UniFi lets you change a
client's device fingerprint in its settings, and **this tool already follows
that**: a client's `dev_id_override` is preferred over the fingerprint the
controller guessed. Correct it once in the console and every render afterwards
picks it up, with nothing to configure here.

The catch is the console's own picker, which is small and only matches from the
start of a name. Searching "Apple iPhone" finds something; "iphone" finds
nothing.

Two community tools make that searchable, both browser-side:
[hubaker/UniFi-Icon-Browser](https://github.com/hubaker/UniFi-Icon-Browser) and
the more actively extended fork
[CANTI-BOT/UniFi-Icon-Browser](https://github.com/CANTI-BOT/UniFi-Icon-Browser),
which adds partial-match search across roughly 5,500 icons and works with
self-hosted controllers. Neither is affiliated with this project.

Overrides are still the answer when you have no console access, when the device
you want is not in Ubiquiti's catalogue at all, or when you want artwork of your
own.

## Artwork, licensing and attribution

This repository contains **no** Ubiquiti artwork. Device images are Ubiquiti's
intellectual property; they are fetched at runtime from Ubiquiti's public
endpoints and cached under `cache/`, which is gitignored. Nothing is
redistributed here.

If you'd rather not fetch anything, use `--icons builtin`.
